## Overview

The Scenarios feature allows you to model different billing approaches and compare potential revenue outcomes before submitting claims.

## Accessing Scenarios

Click **Scenarios** in the sidebar navigation.

## What Are Scenarios?

A scenario is a "what-if" calculation that shows how different billing codes or configurations would affect your revenue. Use scenarios to:
- Compare billing code options
- Evaluate premium code eligibility
- Optimize billing strategies

## Creating a Scenario

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start New Scenario">
    Click **New Scenario** or clone an existing one
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Services">
    Enter the services you want to model:
    - Billing codes
    - Quantities
    - Time factors (if applicable)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Options">
    Adjust settings like:
    - Premium eligibility
    - Facility type
    - Time of service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate">
    Click **Calculate** to see the projected revenue
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Comparing Scenarios

Create multiple scenarios with different configurations to compare:

| Scenario | Billing Codes | Projected Revenue |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Option A | A001A, A002A | $150.00 |
| Option B | A001A, A003A | $175.00 |
| Option C | A004A | $125.00 |

## Sharing Scenarios

Share scenarios with colleagues:
1. Click **Share**
2. Copy the generated URL
3. Recipients can view (but not modify) your scenario

<Info>
Scenario URLs include all configuration in the parameters, so they work without requiring login.
</Info>

## Cloning Scenarios

Duplicate a scenario to create variations:
1. Open the scenario
2. Click **Clone**
3. Modify the copy as needed
4. Save as a new scenario

## Use Cases

### Comparing Time-Based Billing
Model different time durations to see how they affect fees for time-based codes.

### Premium Code Analysis
Determine if premium codes apply and calculate the additional revenue.

### New Service Planning
Before offering a new service, model the expected revenue based on OHIP fees.

## Limitations

- Scenarios are estimates based on current fee schedules
- Actual payments may vary based on OHIP processing
- Scenarios don't account for rejection risks
