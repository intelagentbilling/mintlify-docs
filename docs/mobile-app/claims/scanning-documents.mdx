## Overview

The IntelAGENT mobile app includes document scanning capabilities, allowing you to capture health cards, requisitions, and other supporting documents.

## Camera Features

The app uses your device's camera with:
- Auto-focus for sharp images
- Text recognition (OCR) for health cards
- Multiple document capture
- Image optimization for upload

## Scanning a Health Card

    From the Claims form, tap the camera icon next to the health card field
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position the Card">
    Align the health card within the frame guides
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture">
    The camera auto-captures when the card is detected, or tap the shutter button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">

</Steps>

## Text Recognition (OCR)

The app automatically attempts to read text from scanned documents:
- Health card numbers
