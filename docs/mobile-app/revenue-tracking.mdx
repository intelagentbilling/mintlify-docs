## Understanding the Numbers

### "Paid" vs "Billed"

- **Billed Amount** - What you claimed
- **Paid Amount** - What OHIP paid
- Difference may be due to adjustments, rejections, or processing

### Revenue Timing

Revenue reflects payment dates, not service dates. A service from January may appear in February's revenue when the RA is received.
